## Description
This is an app designed to display the weather in different cities around the world. It works by pulling data from the Open weather API. When a city is typed into the search bar, a call is made that translates it into longitude and latitude. The API has a range of information on the weather conditions and we decide what data we want to display on the page. In this case it was: wind speed, humidity and temperature.
